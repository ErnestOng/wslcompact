    Usage: wslcompact [OPTION] [DISTROS]

    Compacts the image file of the DISTROS. If no distro is provided it will compact all the images.
    You can get a list of your installed distros with the command: wsl -l
    NOTE: WSL will be shutdown for compacting the images.

    Options:
        -i   runs in info mode, providing data and estimation without compacting.
        -h   prints this help

    Examples: 
        wslcompact
        wslcompact -i
        wslcompact Ubuntu Kali
